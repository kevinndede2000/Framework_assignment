Hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, the U.S. airport hotel industry offers a useful empirical setting in which we observe daily prices (room rates), market shares (occupancy), and demand (airport traffic). Older and less profitable hotels were more likely to apply for PPP loans. Hotels with active PPP loans reduced average daily rates, boosting occupancy and revenues per available room compared to competitors without PPP loans. PPP hotels reduced room rates more swiftly and aggressively in response to negative demand shocks and to price drops by non-PPP competitors. Those differences between PPP and non-PPP hotels were reversed once PPP loans expired. We rationalize our findings by introducing temporary cash subsidies into a model of monopolistic competition with differentiated products and heterogeneous production costs. Combining key model constructs with our empirical estimates, we calculate that for the U.S. airport hotel industry in aggregate, with every dollar of PPP subsidies spent, hotels that obtained PPP loans earned 72.3 cents in extra profits and those without PPP loans lost 70.5 cents. Those estimates imply that every dollar of extra profit to a given hotel with a PPP loan cost a given non-PPP rival 18.6 cents.

m9etoz3r,,WHO,Spectral Image Contrast Based Flow Digital Nanoplasmon-metry For Ultrasensitive Antibody Detection,10.21203/rs.3.rs-952439/v1,,,unk,"Background: Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been widely used as local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) immunoassay for biomolecule sensings. It is primarily based on two conventional methods - absorption spectra and colorimetric. While the low figure of merit (FoM) of the LSPR and high-concentration AuNPs requirement restrict their limit of detection (LOD), which is around ng to μg per mL in antibody detection if there is no other signal or analytes amplification. By now, the improvement of sensitivity has bogged down for years. It also reveals a great challenge of the current LSPR immunoassay in biosensing - pushing the boundary of the current LOD. Results: : In this work, we developed a spectral image contrast-based flow digital nanoplasmon-metry(FDNM) to push the LOD boundary. Comparing the scattering image brightness of AuNPs in two neighboring wavelength bands near the LSPR peak, the signal of peak shift is extremely amplified and quickly detected. Introducing the digital analysis, the FDNM provides an ultra-high signal-to-noise ratio and less sample volume requirement. Compared to conventional analog LSPR immunoassay, FDNM has a LOD down to 1 pg mL -1 within only a 15-minute detection time and 500 μL sample volume. Antibody against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in artificial saliva that contained various proteins was also conducted to validate the detection of FDNM in complicated samples. Of the detection, FDNM shows significant discrimination with a LOD of 10 pg mL -1 and a broad dynamic detecting range of five orders of magnitude. Conclusion: Together with the quick readout time and simple operation, this work outstandingly demonstrated the high sensitivity and selectivity of the developed FDNM in rapid antibody detection.

After target recognition and Cas mediated cleavage of biotinylated ssDNA probe molecules, the probe molecules are bound to magnetic particles. A complimentary ssDNA oligonucleotide quantum dot conjugate is then added, which only hybridizes to un-cleaved probes on the magnetic beads. After separation of hybridized from unhybridized quantum dot conjugates by magnetic sequestration, the signal is measured fluorometrically to provide a signal proportional to the cleaved probes and therefore the amount of target nucleic acid. To demonstrate the power of this assay, a 250 bp DNA target sequence matching a portion of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) genome is used and a detection limit of ~0.5 nM is achieved without target amplification using a simple portable ultraviolet flashlight.

However, many clinical parameters of existent scores are deeply modified by physiologic adaptations. Our aim was to assess the feasibility of a prognosis score developed for general hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in Brazil to predict clinical adverse outcomes in pregnant women upon hospital admission. Methods: : This is a multicenter retrospective substudy of the Brazilian COVID-19 Registry, a multicenter cohort analysis in Brazilian hospitals, which provided an accurate score to predict in-hospital death. The present analysis assessed the performance of this model, ABC 2 -SPH, based on data of 3978 patients, to assess poor clinical outcomes in data from 85 pregnant women admitted due to COVID-19 from March 1, 2020, to May 5, 2021, in 19 Brazilian hospitals. The primary outcomes were death and the composite mechanical ventilation or death, and secondary were pregnancy outcomes and severe/critical Covid-19. The overall discrimination of the model was presented as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: : Thirty-one (36.5%) pregnant women had critical or severe COVID-19. Most of them had no previous comorbidities (64.7%). The median gestational age was 31.0 (26.0, 36.2) weeks;38 (44.7%) women gave birth during hospitalization by Covid-19, most of them by C-section (76.3%). The need for mechanical ventilation or death occurred in 14 (17.3%) pregnant women. Severe and critical COVID-19 in pregnant women was associated with diabetes, inflammatory markers, and abnormal vital signals observed at admission. The model was not able to identify adverse clinical outcomes. The AUROC of predicting severe/critical Covid-19 illness was 0.595 (95% CI: 0.424-0.754);AUROC of the inpatient death discrimination was 0.683 (95% CI: 0.293-0.945), as the AUROC of mechanical ventilation or death discrimination was 0.591 (95% CI: 0.434-0.75). Conclusions: : The model ABC 2 -SPH developed in Brazilian general patients was not able to identify adverse clinical outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19.

The main objectives of the present Italian multi-center study were to describe clinical characteristics, and role of selected prognostic predictors, in particular obesity, in a large cohort of young hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.Methods: Nine Pulmonology Units, across North and Centre of Italy, were involved in this retrospective study. Demographic and clinical characteristics as well as radiological features were registered for all cases. Comorbidity were classified according to their known or potential association with COVID-19.Findings: A total of 263 subjects were included. The prevalence of obesity was 25.9%, mechanical ventilation (MV) was needed in 73 patients (27.7%), and 28 in-hospital deaths occurred (10.6%). Obesity and older age were the only significant predictors for MV in a full model adjusted for comorbidities and markers of severity. Pre-existing comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes and asthma, and increased D-dimer level were significantly associated with higher mortality risk, regardless of age, body mass index, and MV.Interpretation: Obesity in young adults is, per se, a strong, independent, predictor of a more complicated COVID-19, without, however, influencing in-hospital mortality. On the other hand, selected comorbidities, mainly hypertension, diabetes and asthma, significantly impact survival even in a young population, and prompt recognition of these conditions as well as a closer surveillance of this subgroup are highly recommended.Funding: none.Declaration of Interests: Prof. Bonifazi reports speaker fees from Boehringer Ingelheim and Roche, outside the submitted work;Dr. Harari reports personal fees from Roche, grants and personal fees from Actelion and Boehringer Ingelheim, outside the submitted work.Ethics Approval Statement: Anonymized data of patients included in the study cohort were retrospectively collected from electronic medical records.

Ultrasound is a patient friendly, fast and cheap method of assessing muscle ACSA, but manual analysis of the images is laborious, subjective and requires thorough experience. To date, no open access and fully automated program to segment ACSA in ultrasound images is available. On this basis, we present DeepACSA, a deep learning approach to automatically segment ACSA in panoramic ultrasound images of the human rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and lateralis (GL) muscles. Methods: We trained convolutional neural networks using 1772 ultrasound images from 153 participants (25 females, 128 males; mean age = 38.2 years, range: 13-78) captured by three experienced operators using three distinct devices. We trained three muscle-specific models to detect ACSA. Findings: Comparing DeepACSA analysis of the RF to manual analysis resulted in intra-class correlation (ICC) of 0.96 (95% CI 0.94,0.97), mean difference of 0.31 cm2 (0.04,0.58) and standard error of the differences (SEM) of 0.91 cm2 (0.47,1.36). For the VL, ICC was 0.94 (0.91,0.96), mean difference was 0.25 cm2 (-0.21,0.7) and SEM was 1.55 cm2 (1.13,1.96). The GM/GL muscles demonstrated an ICC of 0.97 (0.95,0.98), a mean difference of 0.01 cm2 (-0.25, 0.24) and a SEM of 0.69 cm2 (0.52,0.83).

There are several reasons for this disconnect, including lack of message potency (i.e., credibility and congruence), inflexible/habitual behavior patterns, prevailing beliefs (i.e., vulnerability to, and seriousness of COVID-19), and individuals valuing personal concerns above general public health. For official messages to be effective and advice adhered to, strong, coherent ""strategic narratives"" are required. This article, using a psychological perspective, critically examined prevailing COVID-19 UK Government announcements during the lockdown (23/03/2020) and initial easing phase (10/05/2020). Specifically, it focused on important communication inconsistencies, and identified factors that may facilitate and create barriers to the adoption of essential public health directives. This included deliberation of factors that enhanced source impact, diminished the influence of message content, and the negative consequences of contrary information. Accordingly, this article proposes a framework for providing a unifying strategic narrative on COVID-19, one that helps to maximize the impact of key messages and promote effective behavior change. This framework places an emphasis on engaging the full range of actors and considers ways of reducing the efficacy of false information. The article provides recommendations that will potentially improve the reception of government policy and suggests how strategic narratives can harness the drivers of behavioral change needed to meet challenges such as COVID-19.",2020,"Dagnall, N.; Drinkwater, K.

This study aims to identify and analyze the omnichannel activities of retailers in order to provide a concept of the development of a short-term omnichannel business model under pressure of the crisis. The research found that the COVID-19 crisis has boosted the development of the omnichannel model in retail. The research suggests the following step-by-step measures for implementation of the omnichannel approach have been adopted: introduction and expansion of online shops and delivery services;immediate response to customers’ needs and purchase barriers;establishment of an automatization process inside the company;alignment of company strategies with omnichannel model development;further development of omnichannel strategy via collaboration mechanisms;and improvement of category management & consumer-oriented factors. The study provides retailers’ reflections on the new ways of operating, and suggests how the omnichannel development concept may be driven by external factors, as well as proposing opportunities for further research in the development of the omnichannel concept: detailed analysis of omnichannel strategies, or further steps in medium-term omnichannel development after the pandemic period.

One of the most popular social media sites for providing public sentiment towards events that occurred during the COVID-19 period is Twitter. This is because Twitter posts are short and constantly being generated. This paper presents a deep learning approach for sentiment analysis of Twitter data related to COVID-19 reviews. The proposed algorithm is based on an LSTM-RNN-based network and enhanced featured weighting by attention layers. This algorithm uses an enhanced feature transformation framework via the attention mechanism. A total of four class labels (sad, joy, fear, and anger) from publicly available Twitter data posted in the Kaggle database were used in this study. Based on the use of attention layers with the existing LSTM-RNN approach, the proposed deep learning approach significantly improved the performance metrics, with an increase of 20% in accuracy and 10% to 12% in precision but only 12–13% in recall as compared with the current approaches. Out of a total of 179,108 COVID-19-related tweets, tweets with positive, neutral, and negative sentiments were found to account for 45%, 30%, and 25%, respectively.

This essay looks at how three mainstream bioethics theories (utilitarianism, deontology, Rawlsianism) systematically fail frontline hospital workers who are responsible for rationing medical triage during the COVID-19 pandemic. Taking the pandemic response in New York City hospitals as an example, it then argues that the failures of these theories compounds the sense of “unavoidable moral failure” that additionally burdens these workers with psychological trauma. I conclude that the bioethics protocols employed in most major hospitals function alongside neoliberal governmentality, as an extension of what feminist bioethicist Shelley Tremain calls the “apparatus of disability.” Importantly, for Tremain, the apparatus of disability both produces disability (as a social category) and naturalizes impairment (by equating difference with disadvantage).

The often-observed strong clinical reaction one or two days after vaccination is likely associated with the detected protein impurities. A linkage to later immune-related adverse events is also conceivable.

Along with the increasing number of patients exposed to COVID-19 and the number of patients who died and the enactment of the Policy for the Enforcement of Community Activity Restrictions on the island of Java-Bali in accordance with the Instruction of the Minister of Home Affairs Number 01-04 of 2021, it turned out to be increasing anxiety and health problems. mentality for society. Based on these conditions, it is very necessary to have various aspects of treatment ranging from prevention, recovery, and also overcoming the emergence of anxiety disorders. The importance of Islamic boarding schools as Islamic educational institutions in these conditions will be a fortress of faith and immunity in the face of COVID-19. The spiritual action analyzed was the practice of remembrance of the COVID-19 rejection certificate from KH. The practice of this remembrance indirectly has a considerable influence on the physical condition of the congregation who follows the practice of remembrance. The panic experienced by the public regarding the increasing mortality rate during the PPKM period can be quelled by the peace of mind that results from the practice of this remembrance. Therefore, the mental and physical health of the community will be maintained without ignoring the health protocols determined by the government.

Berdasarkan kondisi tersebut maka sangat diperlukan berbagai aspek penanganan mulai dari pencegahan, penyembuhan, pemulihan, dan juga mengatasi munculnya gangguan kecemasan. Pentingnya Pondok Pesantren sebagai lembaga pendidikan Islam dalam kondisi seperti ini akan menjadi benteng iman dan imun dalam menghadapi COVID-19. Tindakan spiritual yang dianalisis adalah amalan zikir surat keterangan penolakan COVID-19 dari KH. Amalan zikir ini secara tidak langsung memiliki pengaruh yang cukup besar terhadap kondisi fisik jemaah yang mengikuti amalan zikir. Kepanikan yang dialami masyarakat terkait meningkatnya angka kematian selama periode PPKM dapat diredam dengan ketenangan jiwa yang dihasilkan dari pengamalan zikir ini.

The election of Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and the defeat of Donald Trump amidst a global pandemic and following a summer of racial reckoning after the high-profile police killing of George Floyd, among others, created a divisive campaign environment that, as in 2016, included attacks against women, immigrants, and people of color. The essays illustrate the resilience of racist, sexist, and xenophobic rhetoric in political culture—even during a campaign cycle that resulted in progressive change. The authors' reflections reveal how even when we try to disrupt these rhetorical currents in our politics, they persist: in the dismantling of presidential rhetorical norms;in how we understand democracy;in the selection of vice presidential running mates;and in rhetorical responses to disasters like the COVID-19 pandemic.

We evaluate the effectiveness of oseltamivir on COVID-19-suspected outpatients without hypoxia. Methods We studied 13 COVID-19-suspected medical staffs and their cohabitation families without hypoxia, who came to our adult fever clinic from March to May 2020. All patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir) and antibacterial therapy together. Results Most of the infected patients were female (8 [62%]);less than half had diabetes (one [8%]) and hypertension (three [23%]). Median age was 45 years (IQR 26–53). Oseltamivir administration made the temperature fall within 24 hours in part (8 [62%]). Clinical data were compared between patients receiving early treatment (ET) with oseltamivir, initiated within 24 hours, and patients administered late treatment (LT), initiated after this time point. Duration of fever was shorter in the ET group than in the LT group (33 ± 24 versus 94 ± 38 hours;p < 0.01). The time from fever onset to treatment initiation correlated with duration of fever (r = 0.74;p < 0.01) and the time from peak to decline (r = 0.55;p < 0.05). Conclusions Our findings suggest that early oseltamivir administration may lower the duration of fever in COVID-19-suspected outpatients without hypoxia when it is used in combination with antibacterial therapy.",2020,"Chiba, Satoru",,,#ppcovidwho-308389,,,,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-33046/v1,230700668

The very common preventive measures that it advocates for such as physical distancing, quarantine and isolation created problems in several of the societies. These measures created problems of social stigma, discrimination, racism and others. In addition, lockdowns imposed by several governments around the globe made people stay at home without attending workplaces. As the lockdowns were stringent and continued for protracted period that led to several forms of domestic violence around the globe. Deviations in routine work life, sitting frivolously at home, use and abuse of different substances coupled with economic imbalance in families led to many different forms of intimate partner and nuptial violence in families. Many a time it happened so that the women could not access the help owing to above mentioned preventive measures that by default has to be imposed upon the citizens and they have to stay longer with the perpetrator without help. Many a time the woman cannot even leave away the perpetrator and take help in other places as she has other family liabilities and responsibilities of caring for the children and other family members.

Here, we established 60 total small RNA-sequencing profiles from 17 aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) patients tumor and adjacent normal tissue, and EVs isolated from urine, serum, and cancer cell culture media. We interrogated the key satellite alteration in tumor-derived EVs and found that resection of tumor prostate tissue leads to differential expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS), P53 pathways, inflammatory/cytokines, oncogenes, and tumor suppressor genes in the EV nanosatellites. Furthermore, we provide a set of novel EV-specific RNA signature, which are present in cancer but are nonexistent in post-resection patients with undetectable cancer. Finally, using a de novo RNAseq assembly followed by characterization of the small RNA landscape, we found novel small RNA clusters (smRCs) in the EVs, which reside in the unannotated regions. Novel smRCs were orthogonally validated for their differential expression in the biomarker discovery cohort using RT-qPCR. We demonstrate that circulating tumor EVs provide a glimpse of the tumor tissue biology, resolving a major bottleneck in the current liquid biopsy efforts. Secretory vesicles appear to be playing a key role in non-canonical Wnt signaling and miRNA pathways, similar to the circulating tumor cells (CTCs), hence, we propose that such vesicles be called circulating tumor extracellular vesicles (CTEVs).",2020-09-30,"Dogra, N.; Ahsen, M.

A small one-sided opening is not ideal for the wind to move throughout the room. A few design suggestion is simulated under three air-flow speed, to prove that natural ventilation is possible to be adapted, to reach comfort while minimizing the risk of viral transmission. The result is, the indoor wind speed can be enhanced the most at the overall unit area by modifying the fixed window to an operable window, giving upper horizontal opening in the wall across the existing opening, and using gauze doors on both door openings. The furniture layout is proved to affect wind distribution in the room.

This research aims to document elite sportswomen's perceptions of the state of women's sport pre-COVID-19 and the possible impact moving forwards. Research methods: Ninety five responses from an online, anonymous, qualitative questionnaire completed by elite sportswomen mainly based, in the UK, on the impact of COVID-19 on women's sport were collected. Data were subject to a thematic analysis, to determine key concerns, and the frequency data of responses were quantitatively recorded. Results and findings: Most sportswomen felt that women's sport was on an upward trajectory, but many juxtaposed that against inequality compared to men's sport in terms of media coverage and finance. There were concerns that the subordinate position women's sport, with less resources and support, will have severe implications post-COVID-19. However, there were considerations that a pause in sport would allow for personal development, increased participation upon sports return and space for a reconfiguration of sport. Implications: Those involved in sport are encouraged to think more critically about progress narratives in women's sport.

In this paper, we present a new mathematical model called SUTRA for pandemics that have undetected (asymptomatic) patients, and demonstrate that it does indeed accurately predict the variety of behavior observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The acronym SUTRA stands for Susceptible, Undetected, Tested (positive), and Removed Approach. There are several novel features of our proposed model. First, whereas previous papers have divided the patient population into Asymptomatic and Infected, we divide patients instead into Tested (T) and Undetected (U). This explicitly accounts for the fact that, due to contact tracing and other such protocols, some fraction of asymptomatic patients do get detected. Second, we introduce a parameter called ""reach,""to take into account the spatial spread of apandemic over time. Third, we present numerically stable methods for estimating the parameters in our model.We have applied our model to predict the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries, displaying a variety of behaviors.

Methods: : The study was carried out at an orthopedic department of a German hospital between April 2020 and October 2020. After written informed consent was obtained, general practitioners (GPs) of a large adjunct health region could present their patients with orthopedic pathologies to specialists at the hospital via OTCs instead of the usual live consultation (LC). The patients, specialists and GPs were evaluated for their OTC experience and attitude (5-point Likert-scale and open questions, 19 to 27 items). Results: : A total of 89 video consultations took place with 76 patients, 16 GPs and six specialists. The average distance between the GPs/patients and the hospital was 141.9 km. The OTCs were rated as pleasant, and the experience was rated as very satisfying (average Likert-Scale rating, with 5 as strong agreement: specialists = 4.8;GPs = 4.9;patients = 4.7). Following the OTC, a LC was not necessary in 76.4% of cases. Patients with a necessary LC after an OTC showed significantly lower satisfaction with the OTC (p = 0.005). Time savings, the elimination of travel and quick contact with orthopedic consultants were positively highlighted by the participants.

cp0c683t,,WHO,Public sphere attitudes toward rumor sources on COVID-19 epidemics: Evidence from community perceptions in Iran,10.21203/rs.3.rs-30297/v1,,,cc-by,"Background: Advancements in technology had raised a variety of information circulation methods. In the case of the COVID-19 outbreak, misinformation seems to travel far faster than the outbreak itself. Misleading rumors are double-edged swords arousing fear and panic on the one side and a reduction in commitment to sanitary measures and induction of wrongdoing on the other side, leading to the disruption of the mitigation measures to tackle with the pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate the factors affecting individuals’ attitudes toward rumor-producing media in Iran. Methods An online survey was conducted in Iran in March 2020 on the source of trusted information and misinformation along with individuals’ perception of the cause of misinformation propagation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results The results showed that social media were considered as the primary rumor source from the perspective of a majority of the participants (59.3%). Lack of a reliable and formal news source was also introduced as the most common cause of a rumor formation by the participants (63.6%). To identify which media is the main source of rumors, the male participants who had high levels of education and were employed by the government proposed foreign media (P < 0.01);however, the male participants aged 30–50 years with middle income level believed that social media (P < 0.01) were producing rumors. In this regard, the high educated participants (P < 0.001), government employees, and middle-income individuals (P < 0.008) believed that national media produced rumors. In addition, the high-educated individuals (P = 0.002) and government employees (P = 0.009) mentioned that national media produced rumors. Conclusion Although these findings were obtained during the first encounter with the Corona epidemic, the authorities immediately introduced the national media as a source of reliable news, which allowed the media and its journalists to reduce the gap between themselves and public sphere. It is suggested that social networks and foreign media be more accountable in epidemics.",2020,"Banakar, Morteza Sadati Ahmad Kalateh Zarei Leila Shahabi Saeed Heydari Seyed Taghi Lankarani Kamran",,,#ppcovidwho-306236,,,,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-30297/v1,241631672

A partir disso, o presente ensaio visa discutir a saúde mental (SM) na ABS diante da pandemia da covid-19. A pandemia ilumina problemas antigos em que é observado a lógica assistencialista e medicalizada do cuidado em SM. Além disso, persistem práticas de subaproveitamento e não reconhecimento das potencialidades da ABS como produtora do cuidado num espinhoso cenário político-econômico de disputa de poder e que incentiva a privatização dos serviços públicos. Esse jogo de forças tem influência na produção do cuidado, sobretudo em contextos caóticos, de injustiças e desigualdades sociais, terrenos férteis para a disseminação da covid-19. Assim, torna-se importante um olhar mais atento sobre os efeitos da SM na ABS, visto que gestores, profissionais e usuários podem mergulhar na ""cegueira branca"". Portanto, é fundamental reconhecer a legitimidade dos saberes, valores e desejos que movimentam os trabalhadores e usuários dos serviços públicos; ou seja, compreender a SM como um campo relacional e dinâmico.

Several efforts for designing drugs and vaccines are underway across the globe. One of the potential early breakthroughs resulted due to the potential for repurposing existing drugs for COVID-19, specifically by drug modeling using computing power availability. Prediction of inhibition activity is a major step in such computation based drug discovery process. It is one of the virtual screening processes that throws light on particular molecules that may potential drug candidates. The subsequent stages in drug discovery are highly resource-intensive, during which a streamlined analysis of potential candidates can help in optimal design. Thus, the problem of predicting inhibition activity of compounds on proteins has attracted significant research interest. In this paper, an approach that employs quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling of SARS-CoV-3CLpro enzyme inhibitors for the development of activity classification model is proposed. The classification models predict SAR-CoV-3CLpro inhibitory activity for query compounds in the screening process using labels. Moreover, molecular docking analysis is performed using 3 FDA approved drugs that are being used as repurposed drugs for COVID-19 treatment. The best performing model with docking data (RMSD and Binding energy) of these 3 drugs were validated and the results obtained were promising. © 2021 IEEE.",2021,"Mondal, K.; Sowmya Kamath, S.","4th IEEE International Conference on Computing, Power and Communication Technologies, GUCON 2021",,#covidwho-1526278,,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/gucon50781.2021.9573896,241599164

As a result, I conducted sentiment analysis on two sets of data related to the reopening of schools in India and the reopening of colleges/universities in India. The tweets were retrieved from the social media site Twitter using 9 keywords relating to the reopening of schools and colleges/universities. The Tweepy module in Python was used for the extraction process. A total of 2,494 tweets over the course of 16 days, from December 8th, 2021 to December 23 rd, 2021 were gathered. Later a total of 1,510 tweets were evaluated once all of the pre-processing steps were done. The sentimental analysis was carried out using 2 unsupervised Lexicon-based models-the Vader Lexicon and the SentiWordNet Lexicon method. In this study, the outcomes of both techniques are highlighted.

To degrade this highly variable mix of sugar structures, gut microbes have acquired a huge array of different carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), predominantly glycoside hydrolases, many of which have specificities that can be exploited for a range of different applications. Plant N-glycans are prevalent on proteins produced by plants and thus components of the diet, but the breakdown of these complex molecules by the gut microbiota has not been explored. Plant N-glycans are also well characterised allergens in pollen and some plant-based foods, and when plants are used in heterologous protein production for medical applications, the N-glycans present can pose a risk to therapeutic function and stability. Here we use a novel genome association approach for enzyme discovery to identify a breakdown pathway for plant complex N-glycans encoded by a gut Bacteroides species and biochemically characterise five CAZymes involved, including structures of the PNGase and GH92 α-mannosidase. These enzymes provide a toolbox for the modification of plant N-glycans for a range of potential applications.

v2t4a0t7,,WHO,Rehabilitations- und Vorsorgeeinrichtungen in der Corona-Krise: Situation und postpandemische Perspektive,10.1055/a-1676-9574,,,unk,"Background During the early phase of the Corona pandemic (March to July 2020) rehab clinics were supposed to stop offering rehab treatment in order to be ready for admitting low-care patients from acute hospitals. On the other hand, acute care hospitals postponed elective interventions for the benefit of Corona patients and rehab patients denied treatment due to the fear of becoming infected. As a consequence a loss in revenue turns out while additional costs for infection protection management arose simultaneously. Methodology Aim of the study was to specify the economic risks of rehab facilities caused by the pandemic as well as the increasing medical requirements. Based on a structured questionnaire 97 rehab providers were polled referring to e. g. the „medical treatment situation"", the „revenue development"", the „cost pressure"" and the „effects of supporting activities of the government"". Results The revenue of rehab clinics collapsed intermittently up to 70 % compared to the previous year. Simultaneously, additional costs of 349 € per patient and employee per treatment cycle (21 days) accumulated due to decreed infection prevention arrangements. This unplanned cost burden corresponds roughly to 13 % of the revenue per case. The decline of rehab treatments under the pandemic will lead on to an exaggerated demand of medically necessary treatments in future. This congestion of non-performed rehab treatments is prognosed to exceed 20 % to 25 % of the rehab treatments performed in 2019. In 29 % of the facilities the shortage of personal protective equipment was associated with dysfunctional workflows and endangerment of patients suffering an infection. 71 % of the rehab facilities stated not to have benefitted from the procurement initiative of the German Ministry of Health. Discussion The Corona pandemic has reinforced the economic vulnerability of many rehab providers. This, due to additional costs for infection prevention activities, revenue losses owing to reduced occupancy and because of an investment bottleneck accumulated over years. Furthermore, the reimbursement system is complained not to cover the total costs of treatment in an economically sufficient way. Necessary investments in infection protection are a cost-driver but also lead to a factual impairment of treatment capacity. As a consequence, a piling up of medically essential rehab treatment is assumed to happen and will effect an increasing disease burden in the health system. Core Message The risk of insolvency has enhanced for rehab facilities due to the pandemic. Simultaneously, medical requirements have arisen and cost pressure has become more intensive. Because rehabilitation to play a pivotal role in public services the reimbursement system of the rehab sector is urged to be changed. One strong opinion requires to finance the costs of keeping rehab facilities. Indeed, this financing approach should be based on an assessment of the rehab demand. Furthermore, the operating costs are advised to be paid depended on medical quality, physical condition of the patient and the complexity of treatment. Zusammenfassung: Hintergrund Bereits in den ersten 6 Monaten der Pandemie erlitten die Rehabilitations- und Vorsorgeeinrichtungen massive Erlöseinbußen. Dies einerseits durch die Aussetzung von Heilverfahren und Nachsorgeangeboten sowie die Verpflichtung, im Bedarfsfall verlegbare Patienten aus Akutkrankenhäusern zu übernehmen;andererseits führte die Verschiebung elektiver Eingriffe zugunsten der prioritären Behandlung von Covid-19-Patienten in den Akuthäusern sowie die Angst von Reha-Patienten vor einer Infektion zu einem Nachfragerückgang. Demgegenüber entstanden erhebliche Zusatzkosten durch die Organisation infektionssicherer Arbeitsabläufe sowie die Beschaffung von Produkten der persönlichen Schutzausrüstung (PSA) auf einem überhitzten freien Markt. Das Insolvenzrisiko für die Reha-Einrichtungen erhöhte sich. Methoden Ziel der Studie war es, die ökonomischen und ablauforganisatorischen Konsequenzen sowie die Infektionsrisiken für Personal und Patienten einer Unterversorgung mit PSA-Produkten im Bereich der Rehabilitation zu ermitteln sowie die Effektivität staatlicher Eingriffe bei der Beschaffung von PSA-Produkten zu reflektieren. Durchgeführt wurde im Zeitraum 25. bis 28. Woche 2020 eine Online-Befragung unter 79 Einrichtungen mittels strukturiertem Fragebogen, u. a. spezifiziert nach den Erhebungsbereichen „Versorgungssituation bei PSA-Produkten"", „Umgang mit PSA-Versorgungsengpässen"", „Ertragssituation"", „Zusatzkosten"" und „Wirksamkeit staatlicher Hilfsmaßnahmen"". In weiteren 18 Einrichtungen wurden Einzelinterviews zur Praxis des Pandemie-Managements vor Ort geführt. Die Erhebung wurde auf orthopädische, kardiologische und neurologische Einrichtungen konzentriert. Ergebnisse Der Umsatz der Einrichtungen ging um zeitweise bis zu 70 % gegenüber dem Vorjahr zurück, gleichzeitig erhöhten sich die Kosten für Infektionsprophylaxe um durchschnittlich 349 € pro Patient und Mitarbeiter pro Behandlungszyklus (21 Tage), was etwa 13 % des Fall-Erlöses bedeutete. Durch den Rückgang bei Patientenbehandlungen während der Pandemie baute sich ein Behandlungsstau auf, der zwischen 20 und 25 % der Reha-Leistungen des Jahres 2019 entspricht und die Krankheitslast im Gesundheitssystem zukünftig erhöhen wird. Der Mangel an Schutzausrüstung führte in 29 % der Einrichtungen zu erschwerten Arbeitsabläufen mit Infektionsgefährdung für Patienten und Mitarbeitende. Von der Beschaffungsinitiative des Bundesministeriums für Gesundheit fühlten sich 71 % der Einrichtungen nicht versorgt. Diskussion Die Corona-Pandemie hat die Anfälligkeit zahlreicher Reha-Einrichtungen für eine wirtschaftliche Schieflage verstärkt. Ursache dafür sind pandemiebedingte Zusatzkosten, Erlösausfälle aufgrund von Belegungsrückgängen und ein Investitionsstau in zahlreichen Einrichtungen. Notwendige Maßnahmen des Infektionsschutzes erhöhen nicht nur die Kostenbelastung, sondern vermindern faktisch die verfügbare Behandlungskapazität. Als Konsequenz ist ein Behandlungsstau zu erwarten, der mit erhöhter Krankheitslast im Gesundheitssystem verbunden sein wird. Kernbotschaft Das Insolvenzrisiko hat sich für Rehabilitations- und Vorsorgeeinrichtungen durch die Corona-Krise erhöht, gleichzeitig sind die Anforderungen an medizinische Qualität und Infektionsschutz ebenso wie die Vorhalte- und Behandlungskosten gestiegen. Eine Reform der Refinanzierung von Reha-Leistungen ist notwendig: Dies betrifft die Finanzierung von Vorhaltekosten von Reha-Einrichtungen als Teil der Daseinsvorsorge. Hier ist allerdings eine versorgungsstrukturelle und institutionenorientierte Bedarfsermittlung vorzuschalten, um Mitnahmeeffekten vorzubeugen. Weiterhin ist die Vergütung der Betriebskosten qualitäts- und aufwandorientiert am Krankheitsbild und am Patientenzustand vorzunehmen.",2022,"von Eiff, Maximilian C.; von Eiff, Wilfried Ghanem Mohamed",Gesundheitsökonomie & Qualitätsmanagement,,#covidwho-1830239,,,,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1676-9574,244901750

The methodology included a questionnaire to 500 parents and an in-depth study of 138 child/parent pairs. The study comprised: (i) presentation of an innovative recipe in the weekly menu of the school canteen;(ii) meal observations of children’s intake at school lunch during the week of the menu modification;(iii) collection of both parents’and children’s reports on their choices of recipes from the modified weekly menu. The results are commented in light of two important changes that have recently affected Italian public school food procurement: the opening of school canteens to lunches brought from home and the measures adopted since 2020 to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. Both events go in the direction of delegating to parents the multifaceted role of the school in the food arena.

Here we report that intranasal vaccinations with adenovirus 5 and 19a vectored vaccines following a systemic DNA or mRNA priming result in strong systemic and mucosal immunity in mice. In contrast to two intramuscular injections with an mRNA vaccine, the mucosal boost with adenoviral vectors induced high levels of IgA and tissue-resident memory T cells in the respiratory tract. Mucosal neutralization of virus variants of concern was also enhanced by the intranasal boosts. Importantly, priming with mRNA provoked a more comprehensive T cell response consisting of circulating and tissue-resident memory T cells after the boost, while a DNA priming induced mostly mucosal T cells. Concomitantly, the intranasal boost strategies provided protection against symptomatic disease. Therefore, a mucosal booster immunization after mRNA priming is a promising approach to establish mucosal immunity in addition to systemic responses.",2021-08-03,"Lapuente, Dennis; Fuchs, Jana; Willar, Jonas; Antão, Ana V; Eberlein, Valentina; Uhlig, Nadja; Issmail, Leila; Schmidt, Anna; Oltmanns, Friederike; Peter, Antonia Sophia; Mueller-Schmucker, Sandra; Irrgang, Pascal; Fraedrich, Kirsten; Cara, Andrea; Hoffmann, Markus; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Ensser, Armin; Pertl, Cordula; Willert, Torsten; Thirion, Christian; Grunwald, Thomas; Überla, Klaus; Tenbusch, Matthias",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/154d66aeed8fd0b86c5d7b30846e274da7864a15.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.03.454858,236929730

Cancer patients also get COVID infection and in some patients this infection is mortal. In our study, we examined the course of COVID-19 infection in patients who actively or in the past used Everolimus. Methods: Patients who used everolimus actively or in the past were examined in our study. Patients who survive after the first cases seen in Turkey March 11, 2020 ;were evaluated in terms of whether they had COVID-19. Demographic characteristics and primary malignancies of the patients were examined. Patients who had COVID-19 infection and died were identified. Results: Our study consists of 50 patients in total. 14 (28%) of the patients were male and 36 (72%) were female. The average age of the patients is 56.72 (28-82), the average age of the male patients is 52.8 (28- 80) and the average age of the female patients is 57.58 (36-82). 17 of the patients were treated for breast cancer, 11 for neuroendocrine tumor, 7 for tuberous sclerosis, 5 for renal cell carcinoma, 4 for thymic carcinoma, 2 for thymoma, 2 for ovarian ca, 2 for perivascular ecrine tumor. While it is the most common breast cancer in women (47.2% of female patients), neuroendocrine tumor is the most common in male patients (35.7% of male patients). While 13 patients were actively using everolimus (26%), 37 patients (74%) had discontinued everolimus treatment for 1 year or more.5 of our patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection (10% of all patients). 2 of these five patients are actively using everolimus. Of those diagnosed with COVID-19, 3 are women and 2 are men.The average age of the patients is 50.08 (43-66). While 3 patients had mild illness (60%), 2 patients (40%) died. One of the deceased patients is female and one is male. The female patient had a history of using everolimus for breast cancer, while the male patient died at the age of 52 while actively using everolimus for thymoma. Conclusions: Everolimus is a MTOR inhibitor used in many malignancy treatments. In our study, we found that 10% of our patients had COVID infection and 2 of our patients died due to COVID-19. In the group that discontinued everolimus treatment for a year or more, 1 patient died due to COVID-19, and 1 patient in the group still receiving everolimus treatment.

Cases of non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infections due to anti-IFNγ autoantibodies (Ab) were first reported in 2004. NTM and COVID-19 co-infection in a patient with acquired IFNγ deficiency has not previously been described. The impact of anti-IFNγ Ab on the severity of COVID-19 has not been previously explored. Objective: We report a case of COVID-19 infection in a patient hospitalised with NTM infection due to acquired IFNγ deficiency caused by anti-IFNγ Ab. We also explore effects of IFNγ Ab on the severity of COVID-19 infection. Methods: : Detailed immunological investigations were performed. Bio-rad, Bio-Plex methodology was used to detect anti-IFNγ Ab, titration, IFNγ recovery assay and SARS-CoV-2 serology. Anti-IFNγ Ab were tested in patients with severe (COV-Pat) and health care workers with mild/asymptomatic COVID-19 infection (COV-Asx). Results: : Mycobacterium avium intracellulare was diagnosed following bone marrow examination and culture. High titre anti-IFNγ Ab were detected in patient’s serum. The autoantibodies neutralized both endogenously produced and exogenously administered IFNγ. SARS-COV-2 infection was identified during routine inpatient testing. Despite prolonged SARS-COV-2 infection the patient showed only minimal additional symptoms, never developed any significant inflammatory complications and eventually mounted an adequate IgG antibody response to the SARS-COV-2 trimeric S-protein. Elevated titres of anti-IFNγ Ab were detected in COV-Pat and COV-Asx, compared to non-infected healthy controls. The titres were broadly similar between COV-Pat and COV-Asx groups, but much lower compared to patients with acquired IFNγ Ab deficiency. Conclusion: IFN-γ is known to play a central role in hyperinflammatory disease states such as macrophage activation syndrome This study illustrates the potential value of inhibiting IFNγ to prevent pathological inflammatory response to COVID-19.",2021,"Kacar, Mark Cortes-Acevedo Paulina Patel Vinesh Carter Clive Hughes Pamela McGann Hugh Gkrania-Klotsas Effrossyni Baxendale Helen Barcenas-Morales Gabriela Doffinger Rainer Savic Sinisa",,,#ppcovidwho-313631,,,,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-310411/v1,233709170

This study aims to shed light on the mental health status of patients with rheumatic disease (RD) during the massive outbreak of COVID-19 in China, especially the prevalence and severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared with the levels in healthy people. Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted in a cross-sectional study of 486 RD patients and 486 healthy control subjects. We collected participants’ demographic and clinical characteristics and surveyed the prevalence and severity of PTSD and sleep quality in the samples using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and 4 items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Findings: Compared with healthy control subjects (n=486), RD patients (n=486) had a higher prevalence of PTSD (12·1% vs. 4·1%;p<0·001). They also had higher total scores on the PCL-5 and on all four items from the PSQI (p≤ 0·001). Female gender, old age, poor sleep quality, long duration of RD, poor subjective evaluation of the disease and pessimistic subjective perception of the epidemic were identified as risk factors for PTSD in RD patients during the COVID-19 epidemic. Interpretation: During the COVID-19 outbreak, RD patients presented a higher prevalence and severity of PTSD and more sleep disturbances. Our findings confirm the importance of psychological assessment and mental health care in addition to regular clinical care for RD patients during the pandemic.

We performed RT-PCR follow-up studies on recovered patients to assess possible development of reinfections and re-positivity. Method During a 6-month period, 202 PCR-confirmed recovering COVID-19 patients entered this study. Follow-up RT-PCR tests and symptoms assessment were performed one month after the initial Positive results. patients who tested negative were tested again one and three months later. The Serum IgG and IgM levels were measured in the last follow-up session. Results In the first two follow-up sessions, 82 patients continued their participation, of which four patients tasted positive. In the second follow-up 44 patients participated, three of whom tested positive. None of the patients who tested positive in the first and second follow-up session were symptomatic. In the last session, 32 patients were tested and four patients were positive, three of them were mildly symptomatic and all of them were positive for IgG. Conclusion A positive RT-PCR in a recovering patient may represent reinfection.

The instrumental examinations showed signs of cup detachment and therefore, after carefully analyzing the case, we decided to perform a sterile aspiration of the hip in the operating room under C-arm fluoroscopy. Microbiological examinations showed positivity for E.Coli. The patient underwent to surgery to remove the prosthesis and implant a spacer. A therapy with Cefotaxim 2g 1-1-1 for 6 weeks was then set, after which a total arthroplasty was implanted. During this period, the Covid-19 pandemic occurred and therefore the patient performed two nasal-throat swabs, both negative. However, one week after the final surgery, respiratory conditions worsened and we performed a chest X-ray and CT scan, with suggestive images of ground-glass opacification patterns (GGO). Due to the clinic and the characteristic images of the instrumental examinations, the patient was transferred to the observation ward, waiting for the response of two additional swabs, also negative.

Despite the institutionalization of measures by the Ministry of Health (MoH) to fight the pandemic, the cumulative number of people infected with COVID-19 has kept increasing daily. We sought to assess risk factors for COVID-19 infections among Health care workers (HCWs) in selected health facilities of the Lubombo region of Eswatini. Methods: A cross-sectional design and systematic stratified sampling were used to select the participants. Results: The study enrolled 333 HCWs, with the majority (201, 60.4%) being females, and the participants’ mean age was 33 years. The study showed that not having an isolation arrangement in a health facility for people suspected to have COVID-19 presents risk to HCWs for COVID-19 (Crude Odds Ratio (COR) = 2.5, 95%CI: 1.0–6.2), p = 0.50;Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 3.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–8.7, p = 0.038). Likewise, HCWs who rarely followed infection prevention and control (IPC) measures were at higher risk of COVID-19 infection than those who followed such measures (COR = 4.2, 95%CI: 1.1–17.2, p = 0.041;AOR = 6.5, 95%CI: 1.4–30.0, p = 0.016), and HCWs exposed to a colleague diagnosed with COVID-19 were at higher risk of being infected themselves (AOR = 11.4;95%CI: 0.9–135.7;p = 0.054).

In particular, asymptomatic individuals, who transmit locally the covid-19 indoors, have to be identified and isolated. We proposed a 2D cellular automaton based on the SI epidemic model for selecting the most desirable testing frequency and identifying the best fitting size of random trails on local urban environments to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 and isolate infected people. We used the complex systems approach to face the challenge of a large-scale test strategy based on urban interventions, starting with first responders and essential workers. We used the case of Mexico to exemplify a credible and intelligent intervention that reduces the virus transmission and detects economic and health costs. Findings suggest that controlling and stopping the virus transmission in a short period of time are possible if the frequency of testing is daily and the percentage of random samples to be tested is at least 90%.

Furthermore, with large public gatherings either prohibited, limited, or subject to social distancing measures live theatre performed in front of a live audience have been deeply affected. This project experiments with executing performances from home to enable theatre actors to continue to practice and connect with audiences. A series of experiments were conducted to test the possibility of having performers or actors conducting performance from their personal spaces and integrating their work using virtual reality in a combined space for an audience to engage with. This research aims to examine Virtual Reality as an assistive technology in contexts such as theatre performance and use of digital environmental design for actors and performers. The nature of this research project was to determine various scenarios in which a virtual 3D environment can enable, assist and/or enhance a theatre performance for both audience and the actors. For this project a 3D virtual theatre setup was designed, experienced and evaluated by participants drawn from theatre practitioners in the context of focus groups. This article reports on the design and practitioners’ responses and how it resulted in an informed VR solution for theatre performance. © 2022 IMCIC 2022 - 13th International Multi-Conference on Complexity, Informatics and Cybernetics, Proceedings.

As a result, traditional educational measurement is now facing a systematic transformation, that is, from the Assessment of Learning (AoL) to Assessment for Learning (AfL), and finally to Assessment as Learning (AaL). By showing the initiative and the flexibility of large-scale online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper examines the evolution from AoL to AaL from four aspects: participants, test form, multivariate data for process-based measurement, and measurement models for multivariate data. We propose multidisciplinary corporations in the field, which integrate education, psychology, and information technology into the theories and methods of educational measurement. Further, we emphasize that the validity, ethics, and fairness of the measurement should also be considered the critical issues. Researchers and practitioners of educational measurement must persist in pursuing the substantive significance of measurement and provide unique experience and guidance for the theoretical and practical development of educational assessment in this great revolution.",2022,"Yang, Li-Ping Xin Tao",Educational Measurement: Issues and Practice,,#covidwho-1666301,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/emip.12492,246524882

However, online studies of auditory perception, especially of psychoacoustic phenomena pertaining to low-level sensory processing, are challenging because of limited available control of the acoustics, and the unknown hearing status of participants. Here, we outline our approach to mitigate these challenges and validate our procedures by comparing web-based measurements to labbased data on a range of classic psychoacoustic tasks. Individual tasks were created using jsPsych, an open-source javascript front-end library. Dynamic sequences of psychoacoustic tasks were implemented using Django, an open-source library for web applications, and combined with consent pages, questionnaires, and debriefing pages. Subjects were recruited via Prolific, a web-based human-subject marketplace. Guided by a meta-analysis of normative data, we developed and validated a screening procedure to select participants for (putative) normal-hearing status; this procedure combined thresholding of scores in a suprathreshold cocktail-party task with filtering based on survey responses. Headphone use was standardized by supplementing procedures from prior literature with a binaural hearing task. Individuals meeting all criteria were re-invited to complete a range of classic psychoacoustic tasks. Performance trends observed in re-invited participants were in excellent agreement with lab-based data for fundamental frequency discrimination, gap detection, sensitivity to interaural time delay and level difference, comodulation masking release, word identification, and consonant confusions. Our results suggest that web-based psychoacoustics is a viable complement to lab-based research.

A key aspect of that re-energised relationship has been the intensified engagement of State and Church leaders in practices of mutual legitimation. This study examines the case of the new church of the Russian Armed Forces as an illustration of how the Patriarchate and the Russian Government make sense of each other’s power and positions in Russian society. Analysis of the official discourses indicates three key developments. First, both Church and State, in their own right, construct a statist and nationalist normative framework where the well-being and the greatness of “the Fatherland” is of utmost value. The two institutions legitimise each other by representing the other party as acting on behalf of this shared value. Second, the dedication of cathedral to the “Victory in the Great Patriotic War” integrates the Church into this key national narrative and simultaneously incorporates elements of the Soviet past into Russia’s “sacred memory”. Third, the involvement of the Patriarchate and the Kremlin in mutual legitimation constructs a relatively independent Church–State legitimating nexus, making popular support less necessary.",2021,"Kolov, Bojidar",Religions,,#covidwho-1538454,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/rel12110925,239955242

dtcqw4e1,,WHO,Limitations of Visualization Technology and Virtual Instruction in Medical Education,10.1096/fasebj.2021.35.s1.05100,,,unk,"Introduction Traditional medical education has recently seen major challenges due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. New pedagogical methods, including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), are on the rise as alternatives to traditional teaching methods. While AR enhances real world experiences by overlaying information, VR immerses users in a computerized world rather than enhancing reality. It is crucial to understand the limitations of these learning modalities and that at best these approaches should be used to supplement and not replace traditional medical education. Objectives This study is part of a larger project that investigates the advantages and disadvantages of AR/VR in medical education. This portion of the study focused on the limitations of AR/VR and the parameters that we explored are professional and interpersonal skill development, visual haptic training, problem solving skills, physician-patient relationship, technological limitations, and financial challenges. Methods This study is a part of a systematic review of the literature seeking to identify the strengths and weaknesses associated with application of AR/VR to medical education. In this portion of the larger study we outline the limitations of AR/VR in medical education. Results Our research indicates that AR/VR may not provide the same learning experience with regards to professional and interpersonal skill development. In person anatomy learning provides an immersive visuohaptic training experience, which has been shown to promote better recall results in comparison to visual or haptic training alone. Current VR headsets have struggles with regards to video quality and latency, which can cause a sensory mismatch called cybersickness. With the high cost of medical education, AR/VR may bring additional financial burdens for students. A study showed one simulation session totaled nearly $107,000. Conclusion Virtual and augmented reality are rapidly being adopted in many academic fields, and while it is certain that tools using these modalities will be used in medical programs, it is important to understand the limitations that these learning tools pose. VR and AR learning environments can be incredibly fruitful, but in their still-nascent state these technologies are best used as a supplementation to well-vetted existing educational approaches rather than a replacement.",2021,"El-Araby, N.; Kocemba, J.; Dufeau, D.",FASEB Journal,,#covidwho-1821961,,,,https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2021.35.s1.05100,235818410
